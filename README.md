# Plug-and-play-AI-assistant
We develop a plug-and-play AI measurement and diagnostic assistant for prenatal ultrasound examinations. The assistant is tasked with the identification of standard views in real-time clinical settings, the segmentation of key anatomical structures, and the measurement of relevant growth parameters.
